<h3 id="what-are-they">What are they?</h3>

<p>There are more than 7.6 billion human beings alive on planet earth today. Chances are, whatever your offering might be, it won’t be right for all of them. Audience Personas (APs) are models of who your primary target market segments are. APs help us structure our marketing activities, by defining who we’re going to target, where we’re going to target them and what they need (to hear) from us.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-they-do">What do they do?</h3>

<p>APs help us structure our marketing activities, by defining who we’re going to target, where we’re going to target them and what they need (to hear) from us. APs describe your prospective customers, considering:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Demographics</li>
  <li>Sociographics</li>
  <li>Geography</li>
  <li>Needs</li>
  <li>Barriers</li>
  <li>Media Behaviours</li>
  <li>Attitudes</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll break out a segment into its own segment when:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The size (population) of the segment represents a sufficient proportion of your prospective customer base</li>
  <li>The messaging that will appeal to them is sufficiently different from the messaging that will appeal to other segments</li>
  <li>Their media behaviours (which inform targeting)  are sufficiently different from the media behaviours of other segments</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-do-audience-personas-look-like">What do audience personas look like?</h3>

<p>APs are typically presented as slides in the main strategy document. The slides present data using a combination of tables, graphics and text. They are frequently heavily annotated as they often refer to research documentation. APs are generally two slides per segment. APs generally feature:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The name of the segment (eg: working parents)</li>
  <li>A short, prose form bio of the segment</li>
  <li>Sociodemographic information
    <ul>
      <li>Age range</li>
      <li>Gender breakdown</li>
      <li>Education</li>
      <li>Geography</li>
      <li>Income</li>
      <li>Employment</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Attitudes towards your brand
    <ul>
      <li>Positive, Negative, Neutral</li>
      <li>Level of familiarity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Priority Initiative
    <ul>
      <li>Why they need your offering</li>
      <li>Why they want your offering</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Perceived Barriers
    <ul>
      <li>What is stopping them from adopting your offering</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Influencers &amp; Decision Makers
    <ul>
      <li>Who influences them</li>
      <li>What publications do they read</li>
      <li>Who do they influence</li>
      <li>Who makes the decisions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Features &amp; Benefits
    <ul>
      <li>Which of your offerings features will most appeal to this segment</li>
      <li>How can we phrase those as benefits</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Media behaviours
    <ul>
      <li>Which digital media do they use &amp; how much?</li>
      <li>What terminology related to your offering do they use?</li>
      <li>What traditional media do they consume?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Depending on your business, some of the above data points (especially those related to socio-demographics) are not always relevant. In fact, there are risks in bloating your APs with too much detail, as over-specification can result in targeting that is unnecessarily narrow and inadvertently excludes potentially interested prospects from your marketing.</p>

<p>We try to achieve a fine balance between ensuring that APs include all the insights we’re certain about, while also leaving room for unknowns. When building APs always remind yourself that you don’t know what you don’t know. The market may surprise you. Think of APs as a sketch, a means to get you in-market with some sense of direction &amp; focus. As actual campaign data trickles in, expect to refine your APs, or even create new segments.</p>

<h3 id="where-do-audience-personas-come-from">Where do audience personas come from?</h3>
<p>APs are informed by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Consultation with you</li>
  <li>Custom market research we undertake as part of your project</li>
  <li>Custom market research you’ve undertaken prior to engaging us</li>
  <li>Publically available market research, from government publications, university studies, reports from public opinion polling firms or consulting firms, reports from media companies, reports from digital media platforms (eg: Think with Google).</li>
  <li>Private market research relevant to your sector (eg: IbisWorld)</li>
  <li>Our experience with similar industries</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-comes-out-of-it">What comes out of it?</h3>
<p>APs directly inform a number of strategy deliverables like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Audience Journeys</li>
  <li>Key Messages</li>
  <li>Tactical Matrix</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why-do-you-need-it">Why do you need it?</h3>
<p>Different things matter to different people. No matter how amazing your offering is, if you’re presenting it to the wrong people, it’s not going to make an impact. Contrary to popular belief, advertising is not about convincing resistant people to buy your product, it’s about getting your product in front of the right people, people who might need it (now or in the near future).</p>

<p>If you target the wrong people, you’re wasting money.</p>

<p>And even if you target the right people with the wrong message, you’re still wasting money. Different people are going to respond to different benefits of your product. Some people respond to cost benefits, some to convenience benefits, some to more emotional, lifestyle benefits while others will only care about perceived quality or brand equity. Promote the wrong benefits to the wrong audiences, and you’re missing an opportunity. Worse still, you might create a negative association between your brand and that person that will be hard to undo. If you serve cost-benefits, like “affordable” to someone who is only concerned with “quality” or “prestige”, you risk them forever associating you with a discount brand.</p>

<p>The point is, in order to know what to say, you need to know who you’re saying it to.</p>
